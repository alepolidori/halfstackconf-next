        "Join Mynah Marie (aka Earth to Abigail) for an interactive session where we will explore the world of live coding music through the browser using the web platform Estuary. As a seasoned live coder and passionate musician, Mynah will guide attendees through the fundamentals of live coding music, breaking down complex concepts into accessible steps. Everyone is encouraged to get their laptops out and actively participate. Throughout the session, we will delve into Estuary’s features and languages. Participants will gain first-hand experience on what it’s like to use code as a performing arts medium and what kind of challenges live coders face when creating music or visuals in real time. Prepare to be amazed as the collective creativity of CityJS + HalfStack unfolds in this unique group experience! "

        "Going from simple web elements like divs and buttons to creating interactive 3D scenes can seem like a daunting leap, even for seasoned web developers.",
        "But as user expectations grow, it's clear that 3D web experiences are becoming the standard. Whether it's a 360° view of a product, an AR-powered home renovation app, or a sophisticated medical imaging viewer, 3D is changing the way we interact with the web. Thankfully, diving into 3D is more straightforward than ever.",
        "At its core, 3D is just about plotting points in space and some smart math. This session will cover the essentials of how these points, or vertices, become triangles, and eventually pixels on our screens. If you've ever been curious about the 3D rendering pipeline but didn't know where to start, this session is for you."
